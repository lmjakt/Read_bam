## In order to compile read_bam, the command to gcc needs to include the
## following two options:
## CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
##    This tells the preprocessor to look for header files in
##    /usr/local/include
##    This is where I have installed htslib, but if you have
##    in in a different location, then you will need to tell R
##    about it.
##    R seems to include /usr/local/include by default, so I don't
##    need to do anything about it.
##
## CFLAGS=-lhts
##    This tells gcc (the compiler) that the executable should be linked
##    against the libhts library. This is a non-standard requirement and
##    to make sure that the R includes it we need the following line.
PKG_LIBS=-lhts

## The linking to libhts is done when dyn.load() is run from R. For it
## to work, the system linker needs to be able to find it. For most programs
## the shared object files (i.e. libraries / modules / ... ) are placed
## in a set of standard directories. If you can't place libhts in one of
## these, then you can either:
## 1. Set the value of $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
## 2. Tell gcc where to look for the .so file by passing the r-path-link
##    option (see man ld)
##
## I haven't tried either of these options, so I'm not entirely sure of the
## correct way of doing it. I will check that out in the future.
